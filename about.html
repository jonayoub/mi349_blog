        <p>
            Hey! I am a student at Michigan State University and I am currently majoring in computer science. 
            I expect to graduate in May 2023 with a Bachelor's degree. My goal after graduating is to get a full time job as a software developer. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently interning at SolvIT as a software developer intern. I have
            been with the company since July and plan to end around the end of the year. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As I start heading towards my last semesters of college, I have gained a lot of experience
            in different languages and softwares. Some languages that I have gained some experience in 
            are Python, C++, C#, Java, Swift, SQL, and Javascript.
