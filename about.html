               Hey! I am a student at Michigan State University and I am currently majoring in computer science.

               As I start heading towards my last semesters of college, I have gained a lot of experience
               in different languages and softwares. Some languages that I have gained some experience in 
               are Python, C++, C#, Java, Swift, SQL, and Javascript.
