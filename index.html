            <h2>Blog 1: Michigan State Football </h2>

            <p> Michigan State Football is one of the most anticipated sporting events 
                in the state of Michigan. East Lansing is a great place to be and 
                experience throughout the football season, whether you like to tailgate, 
                socialize with friends and family, or even watch the game. The Spartans 
                is part of the Big Ten Conference and has a total of six national 
                championships. As most people know, the Spartans has acquired a new
                 coach, Mel Tucker, in 2020. He has taken the team to a bowl game 
                 already and getting a win in the end of 2021. He has recently 
                 signed a 95-million-dollar contract to be the head coach for the
                  next 10 years.  The team has had a good last two seasons but 
                 this year the team hasn’t been what the fans expected them to be. Most 
                 fans are complaining about the coaching staff, and some are complaining 
                 about certain players. The team's current record is 3 wins and 4 loses at
                 this point in their season. Their next game is against their biggest rival, University of 
                 Michigan. The Wolverines has been dominating this season 
                so the match up during the end of October is going to be a good one.    </p>

            <h2>Blog 2: Apex Legends</h2>

                One video game that has dominating the battle royale scene has
                 been Apex Legends. Apex Legends is a free to play battle 
                 royale-hero shooter game. This game was developed b y Respawn 
                 Entertainment and published by EA. The game was released back 
                 in 2019 but has been growing every day. This game supports
                  cross-platform play which includes PC, Consoles, and various
                   other gaming devices that are up to date. Recently, Apex 
                   Legends Mobile was released in May 2022 for Android and IOS. </p>
                <p>
                Within this game, players can assemble a team of two or three 
                and select characters with special abilities that are known as 
                “Legends”. The game has two game modes which are Battle Royale 
                and Arenas. The battle royale game mode is what they are known 
                for competitively. Usually there are 20 teams of three in this 
                game mode and their goal is to search for weapons and supplies 
                and defeat other enemy teams by using their skills and strategies 
                to be the last team standing. To enable short game times, there is 
                a ring that closes the map to a certain location to make sure the
                 game ends and doesn’t last forever. Arenas on the other hand is a 
                 three-player squad game that is like a deathmatch over a series of 
                 rounds. After a team reaches 3 wins and 2 points ahead, they end 
                 up winning the game.
