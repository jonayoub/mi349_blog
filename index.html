        <h1>Blog 1: Michigan State Football </h1>
        <h3>By Jonathan Ayoub</h3>

        <p> Michigan State Football is one of the most anticipated sporting events 
            in the state of Michigan. East Lansing is a great place to be and 
            experience throughout the football season, whether you like to tailgate, 
            socialize with friends and family, or even watch the game. The Spartans 
            is part of the Big Ten Conference and has a total of six national 
            championships. As most people know, the Spartans has acquired a new
             coach, Mel Tucker, in 2020. He has taken the team to a bowl game 
             already and getting a win in the end of 2021. He has recently 
             signed a 95-million-dollar contract to be the head coach for the
              next 10 years.  The team has had a good last two seasons but 
             this year the team hasnâ€™t been what the fans expected them to be. Most 
             fans are complaining about the coaching staff, and some are complaining 
             about certain players. The team's current record is 3 wins and 4 loses at
             this point in their season. Their next game is against their biggest rival, University of 
             Michigan. The Wolverines has been dominating this season 
            so the match up during the end of October is going to be a good one.    </p>
